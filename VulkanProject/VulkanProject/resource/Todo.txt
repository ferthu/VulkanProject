Todo:

/M
Build versions of compute experiment.
	- Memory dependent RegLimited task (use image reads somehow)
	- Sequential execution
Gaussian blur compute pass
Allow compute pass to overlap frame
Async. compute settings

Issues:

Commented //defineFramebufShadowMap(shadowMapFormat)

Good practices when working here:

Name VulkanRenderer: _renderHandle, in objects
Pref. all pointer handles (not owned by the object), name _handleXXX.

First time it's ok to comment a set of code that should be dynamic (eg. parameters are determined by an bool, string or w/e), 
but pref. fix dynamic func. second time you comment/uncomment it...
